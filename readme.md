### Abstract

Over the past 30 years, bubble tea in America has gone from a niche Taiwanese beverage to a mainstream iconic cultural symbol for Asian Americans.Bubble tea and boba, refer to the same tea-based beverage with toppings. Also, the word boba has become so widely used in this community socially as a controversial noun in the discussion of  defying unique cultural traits for immigrants . The purpose of this study is to explore and visualize the reasons behind the popularity of boba. It is hoped that through the cultural symbol created by a beverage in this era, it will trigger people to realize and reexamine the "Asian-ness". Overall, It's a matter of “becoming”  as  how people choose to identify themselves
